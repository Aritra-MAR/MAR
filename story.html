<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The crazy Monkey experiment</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">A scientist put five monkeys in a cage and placed, a ladder with bananas on the top in the middle of cage.<br /> Every time a monkey would try to went up to the ladder, the scientist would soak the rest of the monkeys with ice cold water.<br /> So the next time a monkey went up the ladder, the others beat up the one on the ladder thus taking the monkey down.<br /> After a while, no monkey dared to go up the ladder regardless of the temptation.<br /> The scientist then replaced one of the monkeys.This new monkey also tried to climb the ladder only to get beaten by the other monkeys.<br /> After few beatings, the new monkey realized not to climb the ladder even though he never knew the reason.<br />A second monkey was substituted and the same scenairio occurred. <br />The first monkey also participated on the beating of the second monkey. A third monkey was changed and the same process was repeated (beating).<br /> The fourth was replaced and the beating was repeated and finally the fifth monkey was replaced.<br /> What left was a group of five monkeys that even though never received a ice cold shower(the reason not to climb ladder),<br/> continued to beat up any monkey who attempted to climb the ladder.<br /> If it was possible to ask the monkeys why they would beat up all those who attempted to <br />climb the ladder ... Perhaps the answer would be ... "I don't know &mdash;maybe that's how things are done here"<br />Whether it career or choices we make, we subconsciously just walk the track laid down by others(society) without even questioning.<br /> If only we could dare to question and lay our own path.</p>
