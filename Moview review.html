<p style="text-align: center;">The Wind Rises is a movie that makes us think , it starts strong with a little boy&rsquo;s desire to be a pilot and a set of story-lines to an esthetic ending.<br />It is a fictionalized biography of Jiro Horikoshi, the designer of the Mitsubishi A5M and A6M Zero fighters, The story is uplifted by a wonderful visual style , sound design and storyline that remains consistently the best part of the movie. The scenery , clouds , weather and villages form the most complex and compelling character of the film. <br />The Wind Rises carries us through a plot that wanders through engineering, early 20th century geopolitics, Japanese summer hotel culture, Japanese Imperial politics, an abstract meditation on the horrors of war. The animation and visual effects charms the viewers to believe and get absorbed into the Miyazaki's version of that of time.<br />As the movie progresses,It wanders through various complexities of imperial Japanese internal and international politics. We get to realize the complexities of the war ridden Japan and the protagonist's view towards it as it gets parallely tested with failures.Viewers get to appreciate the history of the early 20th century that Miyazaki shows but never voices.<br />The Wind Rises is best description of an intensely complex and overwhelming period of time, wonderfully narrated by Miyazaki that we get to appreciate throughout the movie.<br />It's visuals and moral uncertainty, and the complex subject matter of the plot make it worth watching and admire it.</p>
